SRP -- Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle is the key software engineering principle which determines how we should modularise 
code in object oriented programming . It basically says that for class created it should have a single responsibility. 

It strongly goes against the fact supposedly if a class has 20 parameters in the constructor, and also that class only does one thing, 
how does it have 20 dependencies? That's like going on a fishing trip and bringing along a fishing pole, tackle box, quilting supplies, 
bowling ball, nunchucks, flame thrower, etc.... If you need all that to go fishing, you're not just going fishing.
